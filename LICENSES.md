# Licenses and attribution

## Course content

**Original material:** MASKOR Institute, FH Aachen University of Applied
Sciences, and the Carologistics and ALeRT teams.

This site consolidates and rewrites three internal MASKOR teaching resources:

- the **ROS Summer School** documentation (MASCOR Institute, FH Aachen);
- the **ALeRT / Spot practical course** (MASCOR Institute, FH Aachen — Aachen
  Legged Rescue Team);
- the **Carologistics team wiki** (Team Carologistics, FH Aachen and RWTH
  Aachen).

> **Decision needed — the content license has not been chosen.**
>
> The institute and the original rights holders (the Summer School,
> Carologistics and ALeRT teams) have not yet chosen a license for this
> course text, so this repository deliberately ships **no `LICENSE` file**
> and this document does **not** pick one on their behalf. Until a decision
> is made, no terms of reuse are granted beyond what applies by default under
> copyright law — effectively "all rights reserved."
>
> This is tracked as an open decision in `DECISIONS_NEEDED.md` (item 1) in
> the repository root, including a neutral summary of the available options
> and their trade-offs, so that the institute can decide without this
> document steering the choice. It should be settled before the site is
> widely publicised.

### How the source material was used

- Overlapping explanations were **rewritten as a single consolidated text**,
  not copied and not concatenated.
- **No files were copied** from the source websites: no HTML, no CSS, no
  JavaScript, no fonts, no images.
- **No images from the source material are published.** See
  `CONTENT_REVIEW.md` §4.4.
- Short **code examples** demonstrating a technique were adapted from the
  source teaching material and from official project documentation. They are
  minimal teaching examples; where an example derives substantially from an
  external project, the page links to it.
- Attribution to the MASKOR Institute and to each currently listed source
  course was, until the public source-and-license page was removed (see the
  note below), given there.

> **Note (2026-09-02):** since this repository record was first written, the
> course text has gone through two further full rewrites (restructuring into
> a practical-task format, then removing all event- and facilitator-specific
> framing), with every technical claim re-verified against official primary
> documentation for the ROS 2 Humble baseline.
>
> **Update:** the public `docs/reference/sources.md` page this note used to
> point to has since been removed from the built website, per a later
> content-management decision to keep the public site free of a dedicated
> source/provenance chapter. This document (`LICENSES.md`) remains the
> authoritative, repository-only record of attribution and licensing; it
> intentionally does not appear in the site's navigation, search index or
> built HTML.

### Logos

Rights for the MASKOR, ALeRT and Carologistics logos are not established, so
the site uses a **text title** instead. Replacing it with a logo requires
confirmation from the institute.

## Site toolchain

All installed from PyPI as declared dependencies in `requirements.txt`. None
are vendored into this repository.

| Component | Version | License |
|---|---|---|
| [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) | 7.4.7 | BSD-2-Clause |
| [sphinx-rtd-theme](https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme) | 3.0.2 | MIT |
| [MyST-Parser](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) | 3.0.1 | MIT |
| [sphinx-copybutton](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-copybutton) | 0.5.2 | MIT |
| [sphinx-design](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-design) | 0.6.1 | MIT |

The theme is used **as a dependency**, exactly as intended by its authors. The
Read the Docs theme bundles Font Awesome (SIL OFL 1.1 / MIT) and the Lato and
Roboto Slab fonts (SIL OFL 1.1); these come from the theme package and are not
redistributed separately by this repository.

### Files written for this project

| File | Notes |
|---|---|
| `docs/_static/css/custom.css` | Written from scratch. Adapts the stock RTD theme to the Summer School's look and adds task, solution, review and badge styling plus a dark palette. No CSS from any source site is included. |
| `docs/_static/js/color-mode.js` | Written from scratch. Light/dark toggle with OS-preference detection and `localStorage` persistence. No third-party code. |
| `docs/conf.py` | Written from scratch. |
| `.github/workflows/pages.yml` | Written from scratch, using GitHub's official first-party actions. |

The dark-mode approach is functionally similar to the
[`sphinx_rtd_dark_mode`](https://github.com/MrDogeBro/sphinx_rtd_dark_mode)
extension used by the original Summer School site. That extension is **not**
used here and none of its code is copied — see "Deviations" in `README.md` for
why it was reimplemented.
