"""
ROS 2 practical task -- starter file.

Drive turtlesim's turtle through a square, with no keyboard input, using
only a timer callback and a small state machine (DRIVE / TURN / DONE) --
the same state-machine shape Autonomous Decision-Making formalises later
on this site.

Fill in every ``# TODO`` block below. Nothing here is a trick: every piece
you need (the publisher, the message type, the timer pattern) was already
used in this topic's guided example against the exact same topic,
`/turtle1/cmd_vel`.

Run it with:

    ros2 run turtle_tutorial turtle_controller

...against a running `turtlesim_node` in another terminal. The solution is
in `examples/ros2_turtlesim/solutions/turtle_controller_solution.py`
in this repository -- try it yourself first.
