# Data labeling

{{ advanced }} **Status: advanced reading.** Needed only if you train a
[custom YOLO model](object-detection.md#training-a-custom-model) — not part
of [Perception](index.md)'s core task.

## 1. Collect images

Take **at least 30** photographs of the object, and vary everything:
distance, angle, lighting, background, occlusion. A model trained on 200
identical photos will only recognise that exact photo.

## 2. Label them

Use any labelling tool — [MakeSense.ai](https://www.makesense.ai/) runs in
the browser and needs no account; [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/) and
[CVAT](https://www.cvat.ai/) manage larger team datasets.

Draw a box around each object and export in **YOLO format**.

:::{warning}
Draw the box tightly around the object's actual boundary. Loose boxes teach
the model that the surrounding background is part of the object, and
detection accuracy collapses. If an image is blurred, estimate the true
extent rather than guessing generously.

{{ alert }} {{ documented }} ALeRT's own
[`estop_keypoints_dataset_generation`](https://github.com/RRL-ALeRT/estop_keypoints_dataset_generation)
repository documents a related, more specific case: **keypoint** (not just
bounding-box) annotation for training a YOLOv8-Pose E-Stop-button
detector, using [CVAT](https://www.cvat.ai/) for annotation and phone
photos as the source images. Keypoints mark exact points (e.g. the
button's centre and edges) rather than a box, which is the right choice
when a detector needs to know precisely *where* to press, not only *that*
something is there.

## 3. Organise the dataset

```text
my_model/
└── dataset/
    ├── images/
    │   ├── train/     ~80% of your images
    │   └── val/       ~20%, used to check the model during training
    └── labels/
        ├── train/
        └── val/
```

## 4. Write the configuration and train

See [Training a custom model](object-detection.md#training-a-custom-model)
for the `dataset.yaml` and the `yolo train` command.

## Common mistakes

**Training and validation images overlap or are near-duplicates.** The
model appears to work in `runs/detect/train` and fails on anything new.

**All images taken in one session, one lighting condition.** The model
learns the lighting, not the object.

**Boxes drawn loosely "to be safe."** The opposite of safe — see the warning
above.
