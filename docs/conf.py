# Platform badges.
#
# Every platform-specific instruction on this site must be marked, so that
# readers never mistake a simulation-only instruction for one verified on
# real hardware. The whole site is fixed to ROS 2 Humble (see
# docs/reference/compatibility.md), so there is deliberately no distribution
# badge -- Humble is the implicit baseline for every command on the site.
# Authors write e.g. `{{ alert }}` in Markdown; the substitution below
# expands to a styled badge (see _static/css/custom.css).

    # Difficulty-level badges (Entwicklungsauftrag 8, replacing the course-
    # era Core/Optional/Common/Platform-specific scheme). These mark
    # technical difficulty, not schedule priority -- a topic is Foundation
    # because it needs no prior specialised knowledge, not because it is
    # "session 1". Mark every heading or task with exactly one.

    # "Try it on Spot" safety-level badges (Entwicklungsauftrag 5). Every

    # documentation ({{ documented }}), runnable in Webots
    # ({{ simulation }}, already defined above), actually checked on
    # running hardware ({{ hardwareverified }}), technically plausible but
    # not checked ({{ unverified }}, already defined above), a specific
    # call to actually check on real hardware before relying on it
    # ({{ hwverificationrequired }}), a working but not yet
    # production-ready approach ({{ experimental }}), no longer current but
    # kept for context ({{ historical }}), or -- written as plain text,
    # "Not documented", no badge needed -- no reliable information at all.
    # Never use {{ hardwareverified }} from a passing simulation test.
